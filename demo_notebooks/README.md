# Demo notebooks

This folder contains various demonstration notebooks. Please see their inline documentations. The notebooks can be run without opening Jupyter using the script `run_notebooks.py`. For example,

```
python run_notebooks.py -p Hydrogen\ model\ in\ 1d.ipynb
```

or even
```
python run_notebooks.py -p *.ipynb
```
but this may take a while.
