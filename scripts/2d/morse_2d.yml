# Grid parameters. n = number of
# points in each direction, should be power of 2
# for best results with fft.
# 2L = box size, i.e., domain is [-L,L]**2.
#
# The initial condition is computed on a smaller box of size
# [-L_gs,L_gs]**2, with n_gs points. For best results, this should
# be a subgrid of the main grid. Note that the computed ground state
# is interpolated with cubic splines in any case, so even if the grids
# do not perfectly align, accuracy is still very high.
# The ground state is computed with inverse iterations, and gs_tol is the
# convergence criterion for the norm of the change in the wavefunction.
# The energy is converged to roughly the square of that.
