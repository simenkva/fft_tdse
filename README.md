# fft_tdse

This repository has two parts:
  * A pagage with a toolbox for simulating the time-dependent Schroedinger equation
    on a grid using the split-operator Fourier Transform (SOFT) method.
  * A collection of configurable sample simulation scripts in 1d, 2d, and 3d

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `pip install .`. This will install the `fft_tdse` toolbox.
The scripts are not installed. Probably you would like to edit them and the config files
to suit your own needs. Thus, copy them to your desired location and edit away.
