# fft_tdse

This is a simple toolbox for the solution of the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger
equation using split-step Fourier method. The toolbox is written in a fairly
general fashion, for multiple dimensions, and assumes that the Hamiltonian is
on the form

$$ H(t) = T + V + E(t)*D, $$

where $T$ is diagonal in the Fourier basis, and where $V$ and $X$ are diagonal in the
spatial basis. $E(t)$ is a time-dependent scalar function.

See the demonstration Jupter notebooks for an introduction to the capabilities
of the toolbox.
